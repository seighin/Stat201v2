Questions marked with "(OS3: X.X)" are from the textbook with "X.X" as the exercise number. The answers to the odd questions (odd by book numbering that is) will be in the back of the book.

1. (OS3: 2.17) A 2010 Pew Research poll asked 
1,306 Americans "From what you've read and heard, is there solid evidence that 
the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few 
decades, or not?". The table below shows the distribution of responses by party 
and ideology, where the counts have been replaced with relative frequencies.

\end{tabular}

    a. Are believing that the earth is warming and being a liberal Democrat mutually 
exclusive?

    b. What is the probability that a randomly chosen respondent believes the 
earth is warming or is a liberal Democrat?

    c. What is the probability that a randomly chosen respondent believes the 
earth is warming given that he is a liberal Democrat?

    d. What is the probability that a randomly chosen respondent believes the 
earth is warming given that he is a conservative Republican?

    e. Does it appear that whether or not a respondent believes the earth is 
warming is independent of their party and ideology? Explain your reasoning.

    f. What is the probability that a randomly chosen respondent is a 
moderate/liberal Republican given that he does not believe that the earth is 
warming? 


2. (OS3: 2.18) The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual telephone 
survey designed to identify risk factors in the adult population and report 
emerging health trends. The following table displays the distribution of health 
status of respondents to this survey (excellent, very good, good, fair, poor) 
and whether or not they have health insurance.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rrrrrrrr}
& &  \multicolumn{5}{c}{\textit{Health Status}} &  \\ 
\cline{3-7}
                    &       & Excellent & Very good & Good      & Fair      & Poor      & Total \\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

    a. Are being in excellent health and having health coverage mutually 
exclusive?

    b. What is the probability that a randomly chosen individual has excellent 
health?

    c. What is the probability that a randomly chosen individual has excellent 
health given that he has health coverage?

    d. What is the probability that a randomly chosen individual has excellent 
health given that he doesn't have health coverage?

    e. Do having excellent health and having health coverage appear to be 
independent?


3. (OS3: 2.23) Swaziland has the highest 
HIV prevalence in the world: 25.9\% of this country's population is infected with 
HIV. The ELISA test is one of the first and 
most accurate tests for HIV. For those who carry HIV, the ELISA test is 99.7\% 
accurate. For those who do not carry HIV, the test is 92.6\% accurate. 

    a. If an individual from Swaziland has tested positive, what is the probability that he carries HIV?

    b. (Additional questions, not in book) What is the sensitivity of the ELISA test? What is the specificity?


4. (OS3: 2.26) About 30\% of human twins are identical, and 
the rest are fraternal. Identical twins are necessarily the same sex -- half are 
males and the other half are females. One-quarter of fraternal twins are both 
male, one-quarter both female, and one-half are mixes: one male, one female. You 
have just become a parent of twins and are told they are both girls. Given this 
information, what is the probability that they are identical?



5. (OS3: 1.17) A large college class has 160 students. All 160 students attend the lectures 
together, but the students are divided into 4 groups, each of 40 students, 
for lab sections administered by different teaching assistants. The professor 
wants to conduct a survey about how satisfied the students are with the course, 
and he believes that the lab section a student is in might affect the student's 
overall satisfaction with the course.

    a. What type of study is this?

    b. Suggest a sampling strategy for carrying out this study.


6. (OS3: 1.20) A study that 
surveyed a random sample of otherwise healthy high school students found that 
they are more likely to get muscle cramps when they are stressed. The study 
also noted that students drink more coffee and sleep less when they are 
stressed.

    a. What type of study is this?

    b. Can this study be used to conclude a causal relationship between 
increased stress and muscle cramps?

    c. State possible confounding variables that might explain the observed 
relationship between increased stress and muscle cramps. 


7. (OS3: 1.25) Identify the flaw(s) in reasoning 
in the following scenarios. Explain what the individuals in the study should 
have done differently if they wanted to make such strong conclusions.

    a. Students at an elementary school are given a questionnaire that they 
are asked to return after their parents have completed it. One of the questions 
asked is, "Do you find that your work schedule makes it difficult for you to 
spend time with your kids after school?" Of the parents who replied, 85\% said 
"no". Based on these results, the school officials conclude that a great 
majority of the parents have no difficulty spending time with their kids 
after school.

    b. A survey is conducted on a simple random sample of 1,000 women who 
recently gave birth, asking them about whether or not they smoked during 
pregnancy. A follow-up survey asking if the children have respiratory problems 
is conducted 3 years later, however, only 567 of these women are reached at the 
same address. The researcher reports that these 567 women are representative 
of all mothers.

    c. An orthopedist administers a questionnaire to 30 of his patients who do 
not have any joint problems and finds that 20 of them regularly go running. 
He concludes that running decreases the risk of joint problems.


8. (OS3: 1.26) A city council has requested a 
household survey be conducted in a suburban area of their city. The area is broken 
into many distinct and unique neighborhoods, some including large homes, some with 
only apartments, and others a diverse mixture of housing structures. Identify the 
sampling methods described below, and comment on whether or not you think they 
would be effective in this setting.

    a. Randomly sample 50 households from the city.

    b. Divide the city into neighborhoods, and sample 20 households from each 
neighborhood.

    c. Divide the city into neighborhoods, randomly sample 10 neighborhoods, 
and sample all households from those neighborhoods.

    d. Divide the city into neighborhoods, randomly sample 10 neighborhoods, 
and then randomly sample 20 households from those neighborhoods.

    e. Sample the 200 households closest to the city council offices.
