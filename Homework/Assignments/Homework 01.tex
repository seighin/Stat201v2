Half of their online customers received the product in purple packaging and the other half received green packaging. After a year of monitoring the customer reviews on their website, the marketing department reported that, "Customers who got purple packages posted 58.326\% fewer negative comments about the product quality. Therefore, purple packaging results in higher customer satisfaction."\\
