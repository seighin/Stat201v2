\section*{Group Work - Week 10}

\paragraph{1} Conduct tests for the scenarios below at a $\alpha = 0.05$ level of significance. Be sure to state your conclusion in the context of the question.

\begin{enumalpha}
\item Researchers discover a new gene which, under the right circumstances, could lead to a mildly inconvenient, but chronic, disease. 10\% of the general population have the gene. One of the researchers thinks that people with naturally red hair have a different frequency of the gene. Genetic tests are conducted on a sample of 65 redheads and it is found that 11 of them have the gene.

\item A coffee shop is interested in the proportion of decaf coffee drinkers on Sunday and Monday mornings. The manager thinks they have a lower proportion of decaf drinkers on Monday. They examine a random sample of coffee orders and find that on Sunday 52 out of 156 orders are for decaffeinated coffee and on Monday 43 out 174 are decaf orders. 
\end{enumalpha}

\paragraph{2} M\&Ms are expected to have the following distribution:\\
\smallskip
{\centering
\begin{tabular}{r | c c c c c c }
Color & Blue & Brown & Green & Orange & Red & Yellow\\
Percent & 24\% & 14\% & 15\% & 20\% & 13\% & 14\% 
\end{tabular}
\par} 
\begin{enumalpha}
\item What is the minimum number of M\&Ms needed to do a valid goodness-of-fit test against the expected distribution. In other words, what is the sample size $n$ so that the smallest expected value is at least 5?
\vspace{2.5in}

\item Conduct a goodness-of-fit test of whether the distribution of M\&Ms is what is claimed by the company at a significance level of $\alpha=0.05$. Make sure to state the null and alternative hypotheses, and your conclusion in context of question.

\end{enumalpha}



\newpage
\paragraph{2} The Tortilla and Cheese Organization (TACO) thinks that preferences for types of tacos are the same for men and women. They conduct a survey and collect the following data (``taco\_preference.csv" on D2L):\\
\medskip
{\centering
\begin{tabular}{c | c  c c c}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{4}{c}{\large Type of taco}\\
Gender & Beef & Pork & Chicken & Fish\\
\hline
Men & 105 & 34 & 56 & 27\\
Women & 83 & 29 & 75 & 35 \\
\end{tabular}
\par}
\bigskip
Test the claim the taco preference is the same for men and women at $\alpha = 0.05$ level of significance. Make sure to state the null and alternative hypotheses, and your conclusion in context of question.
