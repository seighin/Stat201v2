\begin{frame}{Context and statistics}
\begin{quote}
``Few treatment options are available to people facing a second battle with a particularly fatal type of brain tumor called glioblastoma." 
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
``Of 61 people with recurring glioblastoma who were treated with the modified [polio] virus, 21 percent were alive after three years. In a “historical” comparison group of 104 patients, who would have been eligible for the treatment but died before it was available, 4 percent lived as long,"
